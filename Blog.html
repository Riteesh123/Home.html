		<p>My inspiration is DR A.P.J Abdul Kalam,who is a great scientist,teacher and more over a good man.I think a person like him is unique. His ideals must be developed by everyone of us.This is the only way by which we can develop our country.</p>
		<p>I am huge fan of Marvel movies.My favourite character is Iron man.I am impressed by his thinking and inventions.This creates some ignition in young minds,which makes them move towards innovative things.</p>
		<p>My thoughts and opinions are never ending.I will discuss many of them in coming days.</p>
