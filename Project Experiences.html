		<p>Basically I have strictly alloted my time for the past four years to studies in order to crack JEE.So I dont have any high end project experiences to share.</p>
		<p>I have been a part of many Science projects in my childhood.Thse were very interesting at those days.I have done many working models. Some of them are </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hydrolic crusher,lift,vehicles,..</li>
			<li>Renewable sources of energy,Ways to save electricity,..</li>
			<li>Air powered jet,Remote controlled car,..</li>
			<li>A perpetual motion machine</li>
		</ul>
		<pre>Now, I am in a project which deals in cleaning the lakes that are filled with floating wastes
like weeds,plastics,and other materials.I have a great team to lead. 
Hope it would be a big success.  </pre>
